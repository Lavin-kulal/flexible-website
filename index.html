                <h1>World War I</h1>
                <p>
                    Germany's strategy for a war on two fronts against France and Russia was to rapidly concentrate the bulk of its army in the West to defeat France within 6 weeks, then shift forces to the East before Russia could fully mobilize; this was later known as the Schlieffen Plan. On August 2nd, Germany demanded free passage through Belgium, an essential element in achieving a quick victory over France.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When this was refused, German forces invaded Belgium on August 3rd and declared war on France the same day. The Belgian government invoked the 1839 Treaty of London and, in compliance with its obligations under this treaty, Britain declared war on Germany on August 4th. On August 12th, Britain and France also declared war on Austria-Hungary, while on August 23rd, Japan sided with Britain, seizing German possessions in China and the Pacific.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In November 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered the war on the side of Austria-Hungary and Germany, opening fronts in the Caucasus, Mesopotamia, and the Sinai Peninsula. The war was fought across each power's colonial empire, spreading the conflict to Africa and across the globe.

                <h1>U.S. Entry into World War I, 1917</h1>
                <p>
                    On April 2, 1917, President Woodrow Wilson went before a joint session of Congress to request a declaration of war against Germany. Wilson cited Germany's violation of its pledge to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean, as well as its attempts to entice Mexico into an alliance against the United States, as his reasons for declaring war.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On April 4, 1917, the U.S. Senate voted in support of the measure to declare war on Germany. The House concurred two days later. The United States later declared war on German ally Austria-Hungary on December 7, 1917.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Germany's resumption of submarine attacks on passenger and merchant ships in 1917 became the primary motivation behind Wilson's decision to lead the United States into World War I. Following the sinking of the Sussex in March 1916, Wilson threatened to sever diplomatic relations with Germany unless they refrained from attacking passenger ships. The German Government accepted these terms in what became known as the "Sussex Pledge."

                <p>
                    Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific, was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including an attack on the US fleet at Pearl Harbor which forced the US to declare war against Japan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway. Later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943 cost the Axis powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all fronts.

                <h1>The End of World War II</h1>
                <p>
                    On May 8, 1945, World War II in Europe came to an end. As news of Germany's surrender reached the rest of the world, joyous crowds gathered to celebrate in the streets, clutching newspapers that declared Victory in Europe (V-E Day). Later that year, US President Harry S. Truman announced Japan's surrender and the end of World War II.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On September 2, 1945, formal surrender documents were signed aboard the USS Missouri, designating the day as the official Victory over Japan Day (V-J Day). More than 400,000 Americans gave their lives to secure our nation's freedom, and in the midst of celebration, there was recognition that the true meaning of the day was best represented by those who were not present to celebrate.
